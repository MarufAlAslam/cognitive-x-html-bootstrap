                                The team at Cognitive X Solutions were great to work with. They took our simple in
                                house project and revamped all the back end code and were able to implement our
                                feature list easily and intuitively. Deploying our project to other offices should now
                                be a breeze thanks to the updated capabilities and export/import routines that they
                                built for us along with the integrated reporting features. Communication along the
                                way and support after the delivery date were great as well. We will be looking to
                                Cognitive X Solutions when it’s time for version 3.0 of our Client Tracker.
